# ðŸ“º TestTV ðŸ“º


## Overview
This is a simple program written in Python that simulates a TV. It allows you to turn the TV on and off, change channels, and adjust the volume level.

## How it Works
The program is built using an object-oriented approach. The TV class contains methods to turn the TV on and off, get and set the channel, and get and set the volume level. The TestTV class creates two instances of the TV class and uses them to test the various methods.

## Features
a. Turn the TV on and off

b. Change channels

c. Adjust the volume level

## Why Use This Program
This program is a good example for beginners who are learning about object-oriented programming in Python. It demonstrates how to create classes, methods, and objects, and how to use them to simulate a real-world object.
